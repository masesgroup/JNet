# JNet: APIs extendibility

What to do if an API was not yet implemented? The simplest answer is: help us to make this product reacher :smile:
There is another answer which is not available with other products: Dynamic code and programmatically API access.

With **JCOBridge** a developer can use some properties to manage objects in the JVM. 
Each JNet class implemented contains some methods and two properties: a direct and a dynamic accessor able to analyze the JVM class and executes the code.
So it is not necessary at all to have the methods be ready to be used.

Let's go to show some possible conditions analyzing the `Hashtable` class (code at https://github.com/masesgroup/JNet/blob/master/src/net/JNet/Java/Util/Hashtable.cs).

## When a method is not available

The class has a single ready made method:

```C#
public void Put(K key, V value) => IExecute("put", key, value);
```

This is a void method, using **IExecute** the user of the library can invoke the `Put` method on the class and execute the Java counterpart. 
The developer can, anyway, invoke the `put` method directly from the instance of the `Hashtable` class using two different paradigms: **direct** or **dynamic** access.
The `put` method can be replaced with any method (with or without parameters) of the `Hashtable` class.

### Direct access

The `IExecute` method is public and can be executed using the instance of the `Hashtable` class.

```C#
Hashtable<string, string> data = new Hashtable<string, string>(...);

data.IExecute("put", "a", "b");
```

Anyway other methods can be accessed like in the following example where an overload of `IExecute` method returns a **bool** value:

```C#
Hashtable<string, string> data = new Hashtable<string, string>(...);

bool isEmpty = data.IExecute<bool>("isEmpty");
```

### Dynamic access

```C#
dynamic data = new Hashtable<string, string>(...);

data.put("a", "b");
var isEmpty = data.isEmpty();
```

The `Hashtable`, and any other ready made class of the library, supports the **dynamic** access to the methods available in Java side.
The previous example demostrates the behavior.

## When a class is not available

In a more complex scenario the method can return back objects or can accept input of not ready made classes: no problem, there is a solution.

### Return class is not available

To discuss this case we use another class: the [AWT Panel](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Panel.html), implemented in [Java.Awt.Panel](https://github.com/masesgroup/JNet/blob/master/src/net/JNet/Java/Awt/Panel.cs).
The .NET class does not have any implemented method: we discuss about [createVolatileImage](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Component.html#createVolatileImage-int-int-) inherited from the base class `Component`.
The method returns a [VolatileImage](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/image/VolatileImage.html) which is not yet implemented; a solution on this problem is to use directly the `createVolatileImage` Java method like the following code snippet does:

```C#
Java.Awt.Panel panel = new();
var volImage = panel.IExecute("createVolatileImage", 100, 100); // the returned object is a dynamic object which reference the VolatileImage object in Java
var snapshot = volImage.getSnapshot(); // the returned object is a dynamic object reference of the BufferedImage object in Java
var isContentLost = volImage.contentsLost(); // the returned object is a bool representing the Java counterpart

```

The example above uses the classes `VolatileImage` and `BufferedImage` which are not implemented yet: the classes exists in JVM and can be accessed.

### Input and Return class are not available

If even the input class is not available the solution is like the following:

```C#
Java.Awt.Panel panel = new();
var dynImageCapabilities = panel.JVM.New("java.awt.ImageCapabilities", true); // the returned object is a dynamic object which is a reference of the ImageCapabilities object in Java
var volImage = panel.IExecute("createVolatileImage", 100, 100, dynImageCapabilities); // the returned object is a dynamic object which reference the VolatileImage object in Java
var snapshot = volImage.getSnapshot(); // the returned object is a dynamic object reference of the BufferedImage object in Java
var isContentLost = volImage.contentsLost(); // the returned object is a bool representing the Java counterpart

```

In the above example the class `ImageCapabilities` is not implemented yet. Since it exists in the JVM it can be allocated and used.
Each object, like `Panel` instance, exposes (hidden in the editor) two properties:
* **JVM** which access the JVM using methods;
* **DynJVM** which access the JVM using the Dynamic engine.

Using the listed properties it is possible to instruct the JVM about the action to be done.

### Anything is not available

If no classes are available the solution comes from the global accessor available in JCOBridge and the code snippet is like the following one:

```C#
var panel = JNetCore.New("java.awt.Panel"); // the returned object is a dynamic object reference of the Panel object in Java
var dynImageCapabilities = JNetCore.New("java.awt.ImageCapabilities", true); // the returned object is a dynamic object which is a reference of the ImageCapabilities object in Java
var volImage = panel.createVolatileImage(100, 100, dynImageCapabilities); // the returned object is a dynamic object which reference the VolatileImage object in Java
var snapshot = volImage.getSnapshot(); // the returned object is a dynamic object reference of the BufferedImage object in Java
var isContentLost = volImage.contentsLost(); // the returned object is a bool representing the Java counterpart

```

The example above consider that even the class `Panel` is not implemented yet. Since it exists in the JVM it can be allocated and used.
In previous chapter the tutorial reports about two hidden properties in each object; the properties on each class are just an useful reference to the real one available in `JCOBridge.Global`:
* **JVM** which access the JVM using methods;
* **DynJVM** which access the JVM using the Dynamic engine.

Using the properties it is possible to instruct the JVM about the action to be done.

### Call a method dynamically

Look at the simple example below:

```C#

Java.Awt.Panel panel = new();
var result = panel.DynInstance.getLayout(); // this line invokes dynamically the getLayout method on the instance of the Panel

```

As exposed before, each object, like `Panel` instance, exposes (hidden in the editor) two properties.

Explaining the code:
* The first line creates a JVM object in C# style: `Container` lives in the CLR and has its counterpart in the JVM.
* The `result` is a **dynamic** object that can be used to extract data or invokes other methods on the result of `getLayout` which is an object of type `LayoutManager`.

## API exendibility limitation

Starting from the assumption that JCOBridge does not make any code injection, or compilation, within JVM side, the actual limitation is related to something missing within the JVM.
In the [JVM callbacks](jvm_callbacks.md) article there is an explanation of how works callbacks.
**The callback feature needs a concrete class in the JVM and if it does not exist there is no way to use it from JNet.**
