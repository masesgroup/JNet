# JNet: professional support

Looking for expertise in applications mixing .NET and JVM™-enabled languages? MASES Group can help you design, build, deploy, and manage applications that run .NET and Java™/JVM™ side-by-side.

## What MASES Group can help with

### Architecture and design

- Designing the integration architecture between .NET and JVM™-based systems: in-process vs. out-of-process, bidirectional vs. unidirectional, synchronous vs. event-driven
- Selecting the right JVM version for your .NET target runtime (.NET 8, .NET 10, .NET Framework) and managing backward compatibility with existing Java 8+ bytecode
- Mapping Java API surface to idiomatic C# patterns: generics, listeners, iterables, futures, and exception hierarchies
- Assessing legacy Java codebases for .NET integration — identifying which components to wrap via JNet and which to migrate

### Implementation

- Building .NET applications that consume Java/Scala/Kotlin/etc libraries directly via JNet, without requiring Java-side modifications
- Developing JNet-based wrappers for custom or third-party Java libraries not covered by the standard JNet generated classes
- Implementing bidirectional integration using JCOReflector: exposing .NET assemblies as JARs for consumption from Java, Kotlin, or Scala
- Configuring JNetReflector to generate C# gateway classes from custom JARs and maintaining those classes across library updates

### Operations and performance

- JVM tuning for .NET-hosted processes: GC strategy, heap sizing, class loading, and thread pool configuration
- Diagnosing and resolving JVM↔CLR boundary issues, including object lifetime and cross-boundary GC collection (see [JCOBridgePublic#24](https://github.com/masesgroup/JCOBridgePublic/issues/24))
- Guidance on JCOBridge HPA Edition for production workloads requiring the highest reliability at the JVM↔CLR boundary
- PowerShell automation via JNetPS: scripting Java API calls from PowerShell in CI/CD and operational workflows

### Training and knowledge transfer

- Hands-on workshops covering the JNet programming model: JVMBridgeBase, listeners, generics, and the JCOBridge runtime
- Code reviews and architectural walkthroughs for teams integrating existing Java libraries into .NET applications
- Guidance on managing multi-version Java compatibility and JVM upgrade paths alongside .NET runtime upgrades
