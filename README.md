JNet is a .NET gateway for JVM APIs (Java, Scala, Kotlin, ...).

## Scope of the project

This project aims to create a library to direct access, from .NET, all the features available in the Java Platform, this is the counterpart of [JCOReflector](https://github.com/masesgroup/JCOReflector).

There are many client libraries written to manage communication with Java. Conversely, this project use directly the Java packages giving more than one benefit:
* all implemented features are availables at no extra implementation costs, see [JNet usage](src/net/Documentation/articles/usage.md);
* avoids any third party communication protocol implementation;
* access all features made available from Java platform.

## Runtime engine

JNet uses [JCOBridge](https://www.jcobridge.com), and its [features](https://www.jcobridge.com/features/), to obtain many benefits:
* **Cyber-security**: 
  * [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) and [CLR, or CoreCLR,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime) runs in the same process, but are insulated from each other;
  * JCOBridge does not make any code injection into JVM;
  * JCOBridge does not use any other communication mechanism than JNI;
  * .NET (CLR) inherently inherits the cyber-security levels of running JVM; 
* **Direct access the JVM from any .NET application**: 
  * Any Java/Scala/Kotlin/... class can be directly managed;
  * No need to learn new APIs: we try to expose the same APIs in C# style;
  * No extra validation cycle on protocol and functionality: bug fix, improvements, new features are immediately available;
  * Documentation is shared;
* **Dynamic code**: it helps to write a Java/Scala/Kotlin/etc seamless language code directly inside a standard .NET application written in C#/VB.NET: look at this [simple example](https://www.jcobridge.com/net-examples/dotnet-examples/) and [JNet APIs extensibility](src/net/Documentation/articles/API_extensibility.md).
